# Student Performance Analysis

Analyzed a dataset of 1,000 students to explore how demographic and social factors influence academic performance.  
This project covers data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation using Python.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** ‚Äì data manipulation  
- **NumPy** ‚Äì numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì analysis environment

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading** ‚Äì Imported the dataset using Pandas.  
2. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Checked for missing values and standardized column names.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Visualized relationships between features.  
4. **Insights & Observations** ‚Äì Identified trends affecting student scores.

## Key Insights
- Students who **completed the test preparation course** scored higher in all subjects.  
- **Parental education level** shows a positive correlation with student performance.  
- **Reading and writing scores** are strongly correlated.  
- Minimal gender differences in math performance, but females perform slightly better in reading and writing.

## Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

The dataset contains:
| Column | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| gender | Student gender |
| race/ethnicity | Student group classification |
| parental level of education | Highest education level of parent |
| lunch | Type of lunch received |
| test preparation course | Whether the student completed a prep course |
| math score | Math exam score |
| reading score | Reading exam score |
| writing score | Writing exam score |

---

## Visualizations
- Bar charts for gender distribution and parental education impact  
- Boxplots for test preparation effect on scores  
- Correlation heatmap between all three subjects  

---

## Learnings
- Strengthened understanding of **data cleaning and EDA** in Python.  
- Learned how to communicate findings visually using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.  
- Practiced creating a data-driven report that highlights key performance indicators.
